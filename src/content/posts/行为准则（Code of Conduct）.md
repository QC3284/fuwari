# Code of Conduct for QC3284's Blog  

## 🧭 Our Commitment  
As the creator of QC3284's Blog, I (QC3284) am dedicated to fostering an inclusive, respectful community for all readers, contributors, and collaborators. This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions:  
- Blog comments  
- Social media discussions  
- Collaborative projects  
- Email communications  
- In-person events (if applicable)  

## 🌟 Core Values  
1. **Human-first language**: Everyone deserves dignity.  
2. **Zero tolerance** for harassment, discrimination, or exclusion.  
3. **Active inclusion** of underrepresented groups in tech.  
4. **Accountability** through clear reporting and enforcement.  

## ✅ Expected Behavior  
- Critique ideas constructively, not individuals  
- Use inclusive language (e.g., gender-neutral pronouns)  
- Respect privacy and confidentiality  
- Acknowledge cultural differences in communication  
- Credit others' work/ideas (e.g., when referencing open-source projects)  

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior  
- Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberate intimidation  
- Discriminatory jokes/language (racist, sexist, ableist, etc.)  
- Unwanted sexual attention or imagery  
- Doxxing, stalking, or invasive photography  
- Sustained off-topic disruption (e.g., spam, derailing threads)  
- Advocating for or encouraging any of these behaviors  

## 📣 Reporting Violations  
### If you experience or witness misconduct:  
1. **Email directly**: `qc3284@xcqcoo.top` (confidential)  
2. **For urgent concerns**: DM @QC3284 on Twitter/X  

### What happens next:  
- Initial response within **48 hours**  
- Investigation by a neutral third party (not QC3284)  
- Resolution timeline shared with reporter  
- Follow-ups at 30/60 days to ensure safety  

## 🔒 Key Safeguards  
- **Retaliation prohibition**: No penalty for good-faith reports  
- **Conflict resolution**: If QC3284 is involved, an external moderator handles the case  
- **Transparency**: Annual summary of reports (de-identified) published on the blog  

## 🌐 Offline & External Events  
For any QC3284's Blog meetups or collaborations:  
- **Venues**: Must be physically accessible and LGBTQIA+ friendly  
- **Alcohol**: Never provided at official events  
- **Invitations**: Publicly posted ≥14 days in advance  
- **Recording**: Explicit consent required for photos/video  

"In tech, we build bridges between systems – let’s build them between people too."
